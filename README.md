# TEW-tracks

## This data is associated with the paper "A Global Climatology of Tropical Easterly Waves"

As of 3 November 2023, the paper has been accepted and is in the process of being published.

This repository contains TEW tracks based on MERRA-2 curvature vorticity (CV). All cyclonic features were tracked using TRACK (Hodges 1995), and TEWs were identified from the output. More details can be found in the associated paper. Variables including TEW distance traveled, average speed, and maximum CV have been added.

## TEW Tracks with TCs Removed /FilteredNoTCUpdated
These tracks are the main tracks used in the associated paper. TCs have been removed from these TEW tracks.

## TEW Tracks with TCs Included /FilteredTracksUpdated
These tracks are included as the intermediate step between TRACK output and the final TEW tracks with TCs removed.

## Python Code
Code used to add variables including distance traveled, average speed, and maximum CV
